        <h3>Some miscellaneous notes</h3>
        <p>
            Here are various notes that I've typed up over time, either for class presentations, various talks I've given at UNC, or for personal use. 
            These are listed in no particular order, though maybe the top ones are more recent (and perhaps better). 
            All mistakes are my own.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="complex_geom_talk.pdf">Just enough complex geometry to be dangerous</a>.
                These are notes that I've written for a JGMRT talk introducing some of the basic ideas of complex geometry and how it should relate to algebraic geometry.

            <li>
                <a href="Notes_on_quantum_cohomology.pdf">Notes on quantum cohomology</a>.
                Some notes I've written up while I was learning about quantum cohomology of Grassmannians.
                I believe I learned much of this material from Buch's papers on the subject.
                These documents contain some worked out examples of multiplying Schubert classes in 'small' Grassmannians.
