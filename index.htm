                    My name is Xingyu (Tiger) Cheng. I am a 2nd year mathematics PhD student at <a href="https://math.unc.edu/">UNC Chapel Hill</a>. I received my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/">Purude University</a> in 2021 with a BS in mathematics. I am roughly interested in algebraic geometry and representation theory.

            Mentoring
        </h3>

        <p>
            At UNC I've had the opportunity to be a graduate student mentor for the <a href="https://math.unc.edu/undergraduate/opportunities/">Directed Reading Program</a> (DRP):
            <blockquote>
                The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate student mentors for semester-long independent study projects. It is an opportunity for motivated students to get one-on-one mentorship as they learn about a math topic of their interest but is out of the scope of the courses offered at UNC. Topics can include specific problems of interest, more in-depth learning about a course topic, or an introduction to higher level math.
            </blockquote>

                    <b>Fall 2022:</b> I mentored a student on the basics of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. We followed roughly the treatment given in <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> by Cox, Little, and O'Shea.

                <li>
                    <b>Spring 2023:</b> I am currently mentoring a student on the basics of topology and knot theory. We plan on following and exploring topics covered in Colin Adams' <i>The Knot Book</i>.
