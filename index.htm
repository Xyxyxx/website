                <p>
                    My name is Xingyu (Tiger) Cheng. I am a 3rd year mathematics PhD student at <a href="https://math.unc.edu/">UNC Chapel Hill</a> working under Prakash Belkale. 
                    I received my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a> in 2021 with a BS in mathematics and with minors in German and Computer Science. 
                    I am roughly interested in algebraic geometry and representation theory. I think a lot about moduli of vector bundles on curves and local systems.

            Mentoring
        </h3>

        <p>
            At UNC I've had the opportunity to be a graduate student mentor for the <a href="https://math.unc.edu/undergraduate/opportunities/">Directed Reading Program</a> (DRP):
            <blockquote>
                The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate student mentors for semester-long independent study projects. It is an opportunity for motivated students to get one-on-one mentorship as they learn about a math topic of their interest but is out of the scope of the courses offered at UNC. Topics can include specific problems of interest, more in-depth learning about a course topic, or an introduction to higher level math.
            </blockquote>

                <li>
                    <b>Fall 2022:</b> I mentored <i>Marleigh Purgar-Mcdonald</i> on the basics of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. We followed roughly the treatment given in <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> by Cox, Little, and O'Shea.

                <li>
                    <b>Spring 2023:</b> I mentored <i>Aryan Kokkanti</i> on the basics of topology and knot theory. We followed some of the contents Colin Adams' <i>The Knot Book</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fall 2023:</b>  I mentored <i>Paul Hamrick</i> on algebraic geometry by going through Miles Reid's <i>Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry</i>. Our main goal for the semseter was to understand the proof of 27 lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Spring 2024:</b> I mentored <i>Yan Zhu</i> on number theory and basic abstract algebra. We followed roughly some of Ireland and Rosen as well as relevant parts of Dummit and Foote.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Spring 2025:</b> I mentored <i>Yuxin Ge</i> on the basics of field and Galois theory from some sections of Milne's notes. In particular, we focused on understanding fields and field automorphisms.
                </li>
